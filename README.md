Hi, I’m Sonia Karigirwa. I am a full-stack developer with a passion for building scalable and efficient applications. I have a strong interest in exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and solving complex technical challenges. Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge in cloud computing and DevOps, focusing on Kubernetes, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. I'm also deepening my expertise in advanced JavaScript frameworks and modern web development practices. I'm open to collaborating on innovative projects and would love to connect with like-minded developers. Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or through my GitHub profile for any collaboration opportunities or inquiries.
